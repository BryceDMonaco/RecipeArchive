I would like the following to be the basis for stories for epic 4:

The following are bugs encountered while testing:

1. In mobile mode where the side bar can be expanded or collapsed, there are two x 
buttons to collapse the side bar.

2. On some mobile devices, when the side bar is expanded, it does not fully fill the 
vertical space of the screen, and any selected recipe shows a few lines at the 
bottom.

3. Print view stops at one page, even if the recipe is longer.

4. In mobile portrait view, I sometimes could not scroll down enough to reach the 
copy ingredients button.

5. Using the search bar is inconsistent. If I search "bread", all five test recipes 
show up, when only one has bread in the title and no others have it in the title, 
tags, or anywhere in the recipe. If I type in "asian", all five recipes show, when 
only one has the tag "asian" and no others have "asian" in the title or body of 
their recipes.

The following are new features to build stories for:

1. Dark mode, enabled by default, with a simple toggle in the sidebar.

2. The ability to close the red work in progress banner with a simple X button in 
the top left

3. Move the copy button to be immediately below the "Ingredients" header, if it can 
be found.

The following are plans for epic 5:

1. The ability to select multiple recipes from the sidebar, copy all of their 
ingredients at once (same ingredients will be summed, i.e. if recipe A has 1 cup 
flour and B has 2.5, copying ingredients will have one line with 3.5 cups flour), 
and also print all of the selected recipes at once. If a recipe is selected, and the 
search scope is changed such that the recipe does not show in the side bar, it 
should still remain selected. a "Deselect All" button should also be available with 
the copy all ingredients and print selected recipes buttons.
