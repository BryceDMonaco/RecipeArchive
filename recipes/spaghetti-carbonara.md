2. While pasta cooks, fry pancetta in a large skillet over medium heat until crispy.
3. Add minced garlic to pancetta and cook for 1 minute.

5. Drain pasta, reserving 1 cup pasta water.
6. Remove skillet from heat and add hot pasta to pancetta.
7. Quickly stir in egg mixture, tossing constantly. Add pasta water as needed to create a creamy sauce.

## Notes

- The key is to work quickly so the eggs create a creamy sauce without scrambling.

- Use freshly grated Parmesan for best results.
